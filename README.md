## ABOUT THE TOOL

**TorGhost** is a lightweight, efficient anonymity tool designed to route **all** your network traffic through the Tor network. Unlike a simple browser proxy, TorGhost uses IPTables to redirect all system traffic (TCP/UDP), ensuring total system-wide anonymity.

This version (v3.3.0) has been **MODDED & OPTIMIZED** by **INTELEON404** for:

- **Super Fast Performance:** Optimized start/stop logic (connects in seconds).
- **Clean Terminal Output:** No emojis, no box-drawing characters. Plain, readable ASCII output with aligned status blocks.
- **Stability:** Fixed dependency issues on Kali Linux 2023+ and Debian 12.
- **Cross-Distro Support:** Auto-detects the Tor user across Debian, Arch, Fedora, and more.
- **Kill Switch:** Blocks all traffic if Tor fails, preventing accidental exposure.

---

## FEATURES

- **System-Wide Routing:** Redirects all internet traffic through Tor via IPTables.
- **DNS Leak Protection:** Prevents your real DNS from leaking outside the tunnel.
- **Identity Switching:** Request a new Tor Exit Node (new IP) instantly via Tor's control port.
- **Kill Switch:** Rejects all non-Tor traffic if the daemon fails.
- **Auto-Update Check:** Built-in checker to compare against the latest GitHub release.
- **Atomic File Writes:** DNS and torrc changes use safe atomic writes with automatic backup and restore.
- **Graceful Interrupt Handling:** SIGINT/SIGTERM trigger automatic cleanup of iptables and DNS.

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Start Anonymity

Routes all traffic through Tor and displays a status report:

```bash
sudo python3 torghost.py -s
```

**Example output:**

```
============================================================
  [ STATUS REPORT ]  [ TORGHOST ACTIVE - YOU ARE ANONYMOUS ]
============================================================
  > YOUR IP       : 192.42.116.101
  > TOR STATUS    : VERIFIED
  > TRAFFIC       : All traffic routed through Tor

  Use 'sudo python3 torghost.py -r' to switch identity
  Use 'sudo python3 torghost.py -x' to stop TorGhost
============================================================
```

### Switch Identity

Changes your Tor Exit Node to get a fresh IP address:

```bash
sudo python3 torghost.py -r
```

### Stop Anonymity

Flushes IPTables rules and restores your original connection:

```bash
sudo python3 torghost.py -x
```

### Show Current IP

Displays your current IP and whether Tor is active:

```bash
sudo python3 torghost.py -i
```

### Check for Updates

Compares your local version against the latest GitHub release:

```bash
sudo python3 torghost.py -u
```

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Writes a custom `torrc` to `/etc/tor/torghostrc` with `TransPort`, `DNSPort`, and `ControlPort` configured.
2. Backs up `/etc/resolv.conf` and points DNS to `127.0.0.1` to prevent DNS leaks.
3. Starts the Tor daemon under the system Tor user (`debian-tor`, `tor`, etc.).
4. Applies IPTables rules to:
   - Allow Tor user traffic to bypass the redirect.
   - Redirect all DNS (UDP 53) through Tor's DNS port.
   - Redirect all TCP traffic through Tor's transparent proxy port.
   - Reject everything else (kill switch).
5. Verifies the connection via `check.torproject.org`.

On stop, all rules are flushed, DNS is restored from backup, and Tor is shut down.

## SECURITY NOTES

- Always verify your IP after starting with `-i`.
- Use HTTPS websites for maximum security.
- Some services may block known Tor exit nodes.
- DNS leaks are prevented automatically via IPTables and DNS redirect.
- The kill switch (`iptables -A OUTPUT -j REJECT`) is active on failures.
- If interrupted (Ctrl+C), cleanup is performed automatically.
